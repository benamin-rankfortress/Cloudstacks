"@type": "Question","name": "What if I don’t want to talk about something?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "If something feels overwhelming or even terrifying to discuss, that&rsquo;s actually very normal. It can often feel difficult to talk about some things. During sessions, your therapist will never push you to talk about things that are too painful for you to talk about. They will be there to guide you towards discovering what feels comfortable for you to share. Working at your pace, together you can look at the tough stuff if you&rsquo;re ready.

You can also share with them that you are nervous to open up about something, and you and your therapist can talk about that too. Whatever is present for you. Whatever you are going through. Bring that to session and you can explore that together."
}

"@type": "Question","name": "I’m scared that if I open up, you will think I’m crazy.",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "If you open up, we will not think you are crazy. We will think you are someone who&rsquo;s very courageous. Many clients have had the same fear (that people would think they are crazy).

Through our own life journeys and working with clients, we know how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; your experience is.

You&rsquo;re not being dramatic or &ldquo;too much.&rdquo; Nothing you can say will cause us to judge you.

We know nobody&rsquo;s perfect. We all struggle. We all suffer in different ways.

Whatever it is you&rsquo;re going through, we provide a safe space where you can feel heard and supported without judgment."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What can I expect during the first session?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Overall, you can think of the first session as a structured assessment that helps your therapist get to know you and the challenges that brought you into treatment. They&rsquo;ll invite you to share more about yourself, and you can also talk about what&rsquo;s worked or not worked for your mental health in the past.

Some questions that your therapist might ask during a first session include:


	What brought you to therapy?
	Have you gone to therapy before? How did that go?
	What do I need to know about you to understand your current challenges?


You can ask your therapist questions as well. You might be curious about their experience or how future sessions work.

The most important part of a first session is that you see if you feel your therapist is a good fit for you. If you feel supported, seen, and at ease with them, you can discuss if you&rsquo;d like to meet again."

"@type": "Question","name": "How can I get started?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We&rsquo;re here to talk during a free phone consultation where you can tell a therapist what&rsquo;s up and decide together how they can help.

Call us today&nbsp;to get your&nbsp;free phone consultation at (828) 515-1246&nbsp;or&nbsp;Contact Us."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How long will therapy take?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "You might be asking about how long therapy will take because you are currently struggling and want relief fast.

If this is true for you, we want you to know that on average, new clients start seeing small amounts of growth after the first few sessions.

By that point, they feel a little more calm and hopeful that healing is possible.

The total duration of therapy varies from client to client. Most of our clients tend to stay with us for longer than 12 months to be enough to work through the deep issues that are holding them back. While other clients may feel more supported without longer-term therapy.

We will work together to find the length of time that works for you."

<div><p>The Unique Experiences and Challenges Faced by BIPOC Individuals - The experiences and challenges faced by BIPOC individuals are unique and multifaceted. They are often influenced by historical, systemic, and cultural factors including discrimination, oppression, and generational trauma. These factors can result in race-related stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. Moreover, BIPOC individuals may also encounter barriers to accessing quality mental health care due to the lack of representation in the mental health field, cultural stigma, and systemic issues such as financial constraints and geographical disparities in mental health facilities.</p><p>The Role of BIPOC Counseling in Addressing Race-Related Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Trauma - BIPOC counseling plays a key role in addressing these unique challenges. It offers a culturally competent and empathetic approach to therapy, helping BIPOC individuals navigate and heal from experiences of racism, discrimination, and generational trauma. By providing a safe and understanding environment, BIPOC counseling allows individuals to express their authentic selves without fear of judgment or bias.</p></div>

<div><p>In particular, at Resilient Mind Counseling, we use an anti-racist approach in our therapy services. This means we actively confront and challenge racism, both in the therapy room and in the wider society. We also provide tailored mental health resources to BIPOC individuals, understanding the importance of providing culturally sensitive tools and strategies to support mental wellness.</p><p>In essence, BIPOC counseling is not just about treating symptoms; it’s about understanding the root causes, acknowledging the impact of systemic issues, and empowering individuals to embrace their power, authenticity, and voice. By doing so, it contributes significantly to promoting mental health equity for BIPOC individuals in Asheville.</p></div>

<div> <p>The Approach of Resilient Mind Counseling: Providing Inclusive and Compassionate Services - When it comes to mental health care, a one-size-fits-all approach seldom works. This is particularly true for BIPOC individuals, who often face unique challenges and stressors that are deeply rooted in systemic racism and cultural experiences. At Resilient Mind Counseling, we understand this and are committed to providing inclusive, compassionate, and culturally sensitive counseling services.</p><p>The Anti-Racist Approach of Resilient Mind Counseling - Resilient Mind Counseling firmly believes that Black lives matter and that Black is beautiful. This belief acts as a guiding principle in the way we conduct our therapy services. We are determined to ensure that all of our therapy services are inclusive to everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, or anything else. Our multicultural counselors, based in Asheville, NC, are specially trained to understand the unique experiences of BIPOC individuals. They are equipped with the skills and knowledge to address the impacts of discrimination, oppression, generational trauma, cultural beliefs, and microaggressions that you may have experienced.</p></div>

<div> <p>The Importance of Providing BIPOC Individuals with Tailored Mental Health Resources - Navigating through life’s challenges as a BIPOC individual can be tough. That’s why we believe that therapy is an important BIPOC mental resource. Our counseling services are not just about treating mental health conditions; they’re about understanding your struggles, feelings, and trauma on a deeper, more personal level. In BIPOC and multicultural counseling, you’re not just a client – you’re a unique individual with unique experiences. You will be given coping tools and additional resources that are right for you, tailored to meet your specific needs and circumstances.</p><p>The Accessibility of Online Counseling Services at Resilient Mind Counseling - At Resilient Mind Counseling, we understand that access to quality mental health services can sometimes be a barrier for BIPOC individuals. To address this, we offer online therapy services. Whether you are in Asheville, Wilmington, Fayetteville, or somewhere in between, we can support you with teletherapy in North Carolina. This makes mental health support not only accessible but also convenient for those who might have a hectic schedule or prefer to receive therapy in the comfort of their own homes.</p> </div>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>If something feels overwhelming or even terrifying to discuss, that&rsquo;s actually very normal. It can often feel difficult to talk about some things. During sessions, your therapist will never push you to talk about things that are too painful for you to talk about. They will be there to guide you towards discovering what feels comfortable for you to share. Working at your pace, together you can look at the tough stuff if you&rsquo;re ready.</p>

<p>You can also share with them that you are nervous to open up about something, and you and your therapist can talk about that too. Whatever is present for you. Whatever you are going through. Bring that to session and you can explore that together.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>If you open up, we will not think you are crazy. We will think you are someone who&rsquo;s very courageous. Many clients have had the same fear (that people would think they are crazy).</p>

<p>Through our own life journeys and working with clients, we know how &ldquo;normal&rdquo; your experience is.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re not being dramatic or &ldquo;too much.&rdquo; Nothing you can say will cause us to judge you.</p>

<p>We know nobody&rsquo;s perfect. We all struggle. We all suffer in different ways.</p>

<p>Whatever it is you&rsquo;re going through, we provide a safe space where you can feel heard and supported without judgment.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Overall, you can think of the first session as a structured assessment that helps your therapist get to know you and the challenges that brought you into treatment. They&rsquo;ll invite you to share more about yourself, and you can also talk about what&rsquo;s worked or not worked for your mental health in the past.</p>

<p>Some questions that your therapist might ask during a first session include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What brought you to therapy?</li>
	<li>Have you gone to therapy before? How did that go?</li>
	<li>What do I need to know about you to understand your current challenges?</li>
</ul>

<p>You can ask your therapist questions as well. You might be curious about their experience or how future sessions work.</p>

<p>The most important part of a first session is that you see if you feel your therapist is a good fit for you. If you feel supported, seen, and at ease with them, you can discuss if you&rsquo;d like to meet again.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>You might be asking about how long therapy will take because you are currently struggling and want relief fast.</p>

<p>If this is true for you, we want you to know that on average, new clients start seeing small amounts of growth after the first few sessions.</p>

<p>By that point, they feel a little more calm and hopeful that healing is possible.</p>

<p>The total duration of therapy varies from client to client. Most of our clients tend to stay with us for longer than 12 months to be enough to work through the deep issues that are holding them back. While other clients may feel more supported without longer-term therapy.</p>

<p>We will work together to find the length of time that works for you.</p>
