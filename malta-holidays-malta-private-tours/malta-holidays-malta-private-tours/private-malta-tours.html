<meta name="description" content=""Malta Holidays, founded in 2020, is the brainchild of Mindaugas Statkus. Mindaugas’ dream is to show people the unique side of Malta, a country he has at heart. He believes that a deeper dive into the island’s long and vibrant history is key to explore Malta. Mindaugas discovered the Maltese islands during his student years at the University of Malta and the Institute of Tourism Studies. He was lucky to discover the Maltese islands with friends who helped him explore places he would never have experienced on his own. This inspired him to try to recreate these unique travel experiences with a personal touch and led him to start his own venture."">
