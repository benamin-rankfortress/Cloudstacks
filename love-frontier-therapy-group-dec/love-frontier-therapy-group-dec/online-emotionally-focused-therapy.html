"@type": "Question","name": "Weâ€™ve had some bad experiences in the past with therapists, how will this be different?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body."

"@type": "Question","name": "What is different about you than other therapists?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Our focus at Love Frontier is to provide you with therapists who have superior training and skill as well as an open, relaxed style of therapy. As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Our sex life is pretty much nonexistent, can you help with that?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We have felt disconnected for years and I donâ€™t know if I even want to stay married, how can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do couples face problems, what normally leads them to couples therapy, and how does it work?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day."

<div> <p>The first step towards resolving any relationship problem is to identify its root cause. This involves exploring a coupleâ€™s relationship patterns, individual priorities, and relationship goals. At Love Frontier Therapy, we ensure that our therapy sessions provide a safe space for couples to openly discuss their issues. This allows us to identify the exact root of your problems and come up with effective strategies to overcome them.</p><p>Developing Conflict-Resolution Strategies and Effective Communication</p><p>Good communication forms the bedrock of any healthy relationship. It is crucial for resolving conflicts, expressing feelings, and understanding each otherâ€™s perspectives. As part of online therapy, we guide couples in improving their communication skills. This involves teaching them how to actively listen, empathize, and constructively share their feelings and needs.</p></div>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Our focus at Love Frontier is to provide you with therapists who have superior training and skill as well as an open, relaxed style of therapy. As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day.</p>
