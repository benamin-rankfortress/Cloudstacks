"@type": "Question","name": "Weâ€™ve had some bad experiences in the past with therapists, how will this be different?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is different about you than other therapists?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Our focus at Love Frontier is to provide you with therapists who have superior training and skill as well as an open, relaxed style of therapy. As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Our sex life is pretty much nonexistent, can you help with that?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We have felt disconnected for years and I donâ€™t know if I even want to stay married, how can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do couples face problems, what normally leads them to couples therapy, and how does it work?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day."

<p>The Importance of Individual Well-being in a Relationship</p><p>Healthy relationships are not just about the bond between two people, but also about the emotional health of each individual. Personal mental health challenges can create obstacles in a relationship, making it harder to navigate through conflicts, communicate effectively, and maintain emotional intimacy.</p><p>Addressing these challenges and fostering individual well-being is a crucial aspect of relationship therapy. It enables individuals to gain a deeper understanding of themselves and their needs, laying the foundation for healthier, more fulfilling relationships.</p></div>

<div> <p>In sum, understanding these relationship challenges is a critical step towards healing. With professional guidance and therapy, you can equip yourself with the skills needed to navigate these challenges, fostering healthier and more satisfying relationships. Itâ€™s not about assigning blame but about understanding, growing, and healing together.</p><p>The Therapeutic Approach to Relationship Healing</p><p>When it comes to healing a relationship through therapy, several therapeutic approaches can be employed. The choice of method often depends on the unique dynamics of the relationship, the coupleâ€™s needs, and the specific issues they are facing. Here, we will delve into a few key concepts that we at Love Frontier Therapy believe offer valuable insights and tools for relationship healing.</p></div>

<div><p>Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy: An Overview</p><p>One of the primary approaches we use is Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy (EFT). EFT is an empirically supported therapeutic method that focuses on the attachment bond between partners. The process involves a series of steps designed to help couples identify and address the root of their relationship issues. EFT encourages couples to openly discuss their feelings and needs, promoting understanding, acceptance, and secure attachment. This approach has shown high success rates, making it an attractive option for couples seeking to improve their relationship.</p><p>In EFT, we guide couples through a process of profound emotional risk-taking, which can shift their neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. This approach does not just provide temporary relief but targets the heart of the problem, leading to lasting, meaningful change.</p></div>

<div><p>The Role of Attachment in Relationship Issues</p><p>Attachment theory plays a pivotal role in understanding relationship issues. This theory suggests that the way we attach to our caregivers during infancy influences how we form attachments in adulthood. In other words, our early experiences can shape our expectations and behaviors in relationships.</p><p>If unresolved emotional baggage from past relationships or traumatic experiences is affecting how you connect with your partner, therapy provides a safe space to address these issues. It offers an opportunity to heal from these experiences and foster healthier connections. In therapy, we guide you towards understanding and healing these attachment wounds, allowing you to approach your relationship with a clean slate.</p></div>

<div> <p>The Importance of the Therapeutic Relationship</p><p>One of the key components of successful therapy is the therapeutic relationship itself. This relationship, built on trust, respect, and understanding, provides the foundation on which healing and growth can occur. Itâ€™s important for you and your partner to feel comfortable and safe with your therapist. You should feel confident that your therapist understands you, respects your perspectives, and is committed to helping you achieve your relationship goals.</p><p>The therapeutic relationship provides the necessary safe space for you to explore your emotions, fears, and hopes. It allows for honest communication and understanding, fostering a deeper connection between you and your partner. Healing relationship through therapy is a journey, and having a supportive and understanding therapist by your side can make this journey smoother and more effective.</p></div>

<div> <p>In conclusion, therapy can be a powerful tool in building and nurturing healthy relationships. It provides the necessary guidance, support, and tools to address relationship issues effectively. However, the success of the therapeutic process largely depends on your commitment, openness, and willingness to change. The journey may be challenging, but with the right therapeutic approach, it can lead to a stronger, healthier, and more satisfying relationship.</p><p>How Therapy Enhances Relationship Health</p><p>Therapy offers a wide range of benefits for individuals and couples striving to heal their relationships. Here at Love Frontier Therapy, we focus on four primary areas where therapy can enhance relationship health: communication, conflict resolution, trust and intimacy, and navigating life transitions.</p> </div>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Our focus at Love Frontier is to provide you with therapists who have superior training and skill as well as an open, relaxed style of therapy. As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day.</p>
