"@type": "Question","name": "What is a typical therapy session like?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "In the session, we will be actively helping you get to the bottom of how, when, and why you get hijacked by recurring patterns with your partner. The therapist works to help you to express the more vulnerable feelings (that you may have been unaware of) that drive reactivity. You are then coached and guided to share in a profound, vulnerable way with your partner, including what your deeper needs are for connection and attachment. Together, we help you to make sense of what just happened and how the negative pattern between you both has been self-reinforcing and what it&rsquo;s components are. EFCT is a perfect combination of deep emotional insight and sharing with a real meta-understanding of what is happening and how you were able to do something different together in real-time. Together, during the session, we are working to create new neuro-pathways of safe, bonding communication. These new pathways are powerful and can help you to learn how to increasingly break the negative patterns on your own."

"@type": "Question","name": "Why is couples therapy expensive?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy is a very intense type of therapy, our therapists are highly trained and skilled, and it&rsquo;s results-driven (meaning our objective is to get timely, tangible results). The therapy is weekly and considered shorter term (4-12 months on average). The therapist and couple work hard, with the clinician extremely engaged. Like this, we get down to business right away in a no-nonsense way. There is no time wasted, no unnecessary nodding or history-gathering on the part of the therapist. In the end what you spend on a good EFCT therapist can be quite a bit less than you would spend in a mediocre therapy situation that can last several years with lukewarm results."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We have a lot of trouble getting on the same page in parenting our kids, can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This is a very common issue. It&rsquo;s really helpful to unpack what has lead to conflict in the parenting realm and how you handle differences with each-other. You don&rsquo;t have to have the exact same parenting values at all times (this would be impossible anyway!) in order to find connection and common ground in parenting. Ultimately, if you are able to slow down and listen to one-another repeatedly around parenting differences, you can learn from your partner&rsquo;s style and influence each-other in positive ways. In EFCT, we work to uncover the negative emotional patterns and old triggers that can hijack you around parenting differences. That way, we can begin to clear the way towards real listening and learning rather than the tendency to try and control or change one-another&rsquo;s parenting."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "I’m worried about doing couples therapy because I’ve heard of a friend whose relationship ended afterwards.",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "I hear you. Fortunately, this type of couples therapy &ndash; Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&rsquo;s first agenda is to help you to feel closer, not let you disengage or shove all responsibility onto your partner. It&rsquo;s about understanding and turning around repetitive patterns while re-connecting you as a couple. By the end of the session, our goal is for you to feel closer and safer with each-other, not more disconnected. Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy has been proven to be highly effective &ndash; the American Psychological Association states that EFCT correlates with a 75% full recovery with 90% showing significant improvement in their relationship. The other 10% normally consists of physically abusive couples, and / or couples that are facing active addiction issues (In contrast, folks in addiction recovery often do very well with EFCT).&nbsp;&nbsp;In our practice, we are seeing very high success rates with couples who are motivated, committed, and open to doing the hard but rewarding work of therapy together.&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What’s different about Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy compared to other approaches?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We are getting at the root of what you and your partner&rsquo;s issues are. What is keeping you feeling disconnected? What emotional patterns keep happening over and over again? We&rsquo;re not looking to give you some tools and put a band-aid on it, or talk endlessly about your childhood. We are also not going for blaming, diagnosing, or pathologizing anyone. The therapist works&nbsp;to get into the moment of what is happening between you, while interrupting that negative pattern and encouraging&nbsp;vulnerability. This can lead to breakthroughs about what has been keeping you stuck and disconnected. Together in the session, we work to help get you &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; directly and clearly, while afterwards cultivating a coherent understanding of what just happened, why it did, and how to keep doing it."

<p>Rebuilding Trust and Strengthening Intimacy</p><p>One couple, who started therapy following a breach of trust, reported not only a successful restoration of trust but also an unexpected improvement in their sex life. They initially approached therapy with skepticism, primarily for their children’s sake. However, they were pleasantly surprised by the outcomes. “We healed from an affair and also improved our sex life which was more than we bargained for,” they said. “We ended up re-building trust and as an unexpected bonus, rekindled our sex life. Two years later, we have our intimacy back and know how to talk about things that used to shut us down. Thank you!”</p><p>Communication, Connection, and Conflict Resolution</p></div>

<div> <p>Another couple, through our therapeutic interventions, learned to navigate their conflicts without damaging their bond. They developed a deeper understanding of each other, became more empathetic, and built healthier communication patterns. Through various therapy exercises tailored to their unique needs, they were able to address and overcome their relationship challenges. They learned to prioritize consistency and commitment, incorporate therapy exercises into their daily life, set quality time for each other, and seek our professional guidance when necessary, leading to a stronger, healthier partnership.</p><p>The Power of Gottman Method</p><p>A couple who underwent therapy using the Gottman Method, a proven therapeutic approach developed by Dr. John and Julie Gottman, experienced significant improvements in their relationship. By focusing on nine different components, including building love maps, sharing fondness and admiration, managing conflict, and fostering commitment, they were able to replace harmful verbal communication with positive dialogue, increase empathy, enhance intimacy, and breakdown barriers.</p></div>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>In the session, we will be actively helping you get to the bottom of how, when, and why you get hijacked by recurring patterns with your partner. The therapist works to help you to express the more vulnerable feelings (that you may have been unaware of) that drive reactivity. You are then coached and guided to share in a profound, vulnerable way with your partner, including what your deeper needs are for connection and attachment. Together, we help you to make sense of what just happened and how the negative pattern between you both has been self-reinforcing and what it&rsquo;s components are. EFCT is a perfect combination of deep emotional insight and sharing with a real meta-understanding of what is happening and how you were able to do something different together in real-time. Together, during the session, we are working to create new neuro-pathways of safe, bonding communication. These new pathways are powerful and can help you to learn how to increasingly break the negative patterns on your own.</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy is a very intense type of therapy, our therapists are highly trained and skilled, and it&rsquo;s results-driven (meaning our objective is to get timely, tangible results). The therapy is weekly and considered shorter term (4-12 months on average). The therapist and couple work hard, with the clinician extremely engaged. Like this, we get down to business right away in a no-nonsense way. There is no time wasted, no unnecessary nodding or history-gathering on the part of the therapist. In the end what you spend on a good EFCT therapist can be quite a bit less than you would spend in a mediocre therapy situation that can last several years with lukewarm results.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This is a very common issue. It&rsquo;s really helpful to unpack what has lead to conflict in the parenting realm and how you handle differences with each-other. You don&rsquo;t have to have the exact same parenting values at all times (this would be impossible anyway!) in order to find connection and common ground in parenting. Ultimately, if you are able to slow down and listen to one-another repeatedly around parenting differences, you can learn from your partner&rsquo;s style and influence each-other in positive ways. In EFCT, we work to uncover the negative emotional patterns and old triggers that can hijack you around parenting differences. That way, we can begin to clear the way towards real listening and learning rather than the tendency to try and control or change one-another&rsquo;s parenting.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>I hear you. Fortunately, this type of couples therapy &ndash; Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&rsquo;s first agenda is to help you to feel closer, not let you disengage or shove all responsibility onto your partner. It&rsquo;s about understanding and turning around repetitive patterns while re-connecting you as a couple. By the end of the session, our goal is for you to feel closer and safer with each-other, not more disconnected. Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy has been proven to be highly effective &ndash; the American Psychological Association states that EFCT correlates with a 75% full recovery with 90% showing significant improvement in their relationship. The other 10% normally consists of physically abusive couples, and / or couples that are facing active addiction issues (In contrast, folks in addiction recovery often do very well with EFCT).&nbsp;&nbsp;In our practice, we are seeing very high success rates with couples who are motivated, committed, and open to doing the hard but rewarding work of therapy together.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>We are getting at the root of what you and your partner&rsquo;s issues are. What is keeping you feeling disconnected? What emotional patterns keep happening over and over again? We&rsquo;re not looking to give you some tools and put a band-aid on it, or talk endlessly about your childhood. We are also not going for blaming, diagnosing, or pathologizing anyone. The therapist works&nbsp;to get into the moment of what is happening between you, while interrupting that negative pattern and encouraging&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vulnerability</a>. This can lead to breakthroughs about what has been keeping you stuck and disconnected. Together in the session, we work to help get you &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; directly and clearly, while afterwards cultivating a coherent understanding of what just happened, why it did, and how to keep doing it.</p>
