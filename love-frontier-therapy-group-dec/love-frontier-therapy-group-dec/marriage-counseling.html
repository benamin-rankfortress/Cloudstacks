"mainEntity": [{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why is Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy considered short-term?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Because we work towards making deep changes quickly. We don&rsquo;t waste your time by letting you have arguments during the session that you were already having at home. We don&rsquo;t just sit there, taking notes and vaguely nodding. We are actively engaged, with a clear direction, agenda, and goals &ndash; all the while teaching you skills to use at home on your own. Our aim is to get you better and feeling closer, more intimate, and emotionally safe. With that comes results-driven therapy, which in turn fosters confidence. Those ingredients tend to run contrary to endless therapy."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is it possible to recover from infidelity and how is it done?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Absolutely. Infidelity, though hugely painful and upsetting, is something that about 80% of couples who experience it recover from and repair. Couples need four ingredients to do that: 1. End the affair completely. 2. Be willing to talk and admit your mistake. 3. Listen to and express real and repeated empathy for your partner&rsquo;s feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger. 4. Be willing to look at what the larger issue is in the relationship that led to the affair. We have seen many couples recover from infidelity and have helped them to navigate what the larger issues and patterns are in the relationship (often building years before the affair) in order to find a new and more fulfilling connection. Ideally, an affair is an opportunity for the relationship to be re-born on different terms and with new self-awareness for each partner."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How do we make sure we are making progress and staying on track with our goals?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We are all about you asking questions and us as therapists being clear about what we are doing and the science behind it. That way you can understand where we are headed, how, and why. We want you to feel comfortable and knowledgable about what is happening in our work together &ndash; that way, you will also feel safer and be more willing to drop in to the emotional risk-taking that is necessary for deep change. True vulnerability can be challenging and you need to feel safe and clear about why you are being asked to take emotional risks with your partner. We have a practical as well as emotional approach that is just the right amount of each and makes couples confident about where we are going and why as well as how to continue to get there after the therapy has ended."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is online therapy as good as in person therapy?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, we have similar outcomes with online therapy as in person. If anything, online can have better results because couples are able to be present for sessions more regularly whereas before, they may have had to miss sessions frequently which greatly impedes progress. Now couples are not putting off couples therapy for as long because they know that they can access it conveniently, easily, and from the comfort of their own home."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Will you give us tools and homework?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Sometimes and yes, if you request it.&nbsp;Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&nbsp;is not considered a &lsquo;tool-based&rsquo; therapy. Some types of therapy like Solution-Focused or CBT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) are more about giving suggestions and cognitive-based tools. In our experience and training, this is not deep enough. The way to truly shift patterns is by letting the therapist guide you towards profound emotional risk-taking with your partner in the sessions. This can shift your neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. After the experiential work we do in the therapy, we often meta (cognitive) process in order to &lsquo;bake in&rsquo; what we just did. Homework is really just about enjoying the closeness and traction you are working on in the therapy and continuing to create situations that build trust and closeness.&nbsp;"

<div><p>Choosing a therapist is a crucial step in the journey of healing your relationship through therapy. It’s not just about finding someone with the right credentials; it’s about finding a professional who understands your needs, aligns with your approach, and with whom you can build a trusting relationship. Here’s a closer look at what to consider during this important process.</p><p>The Importance of Therapist Credentials and Approach</p><p>First and foremost, ensure that the therapist you choose is a licensed mental health professional with experience in couples or relationship therapy.

<div> <p>Different therapists use different therapeutic approaches. For instance, at Love Frontier Therapy, we utilize Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy, among other modalities, to help couples address their relationship challenges. It’s important to research and discuss these approaches with potential therapists to find one that resonates with you and aligns with your goals for therapy.</p><p>Understanding Your Goals and Expectations from Therapy</p><p>Clear communication is key when starting therapy. Be upfront with your therapist about what you hope to achieve in your relationship through therapy. This could range from improving communication skills, navigating life transitions, to rebuilding trust and intimacy in your relationship.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Because we work towards making deep changes quickly. We don&rsquo;t waste your time by letting you have arguments during the session that you were already having at home. We don&rsquo;t just sit there, taking notes and vaguely nodding. We are actively engaged, with a clear direction, agenda, and goals &ndash; all the while teaching you skills to use at home on your own. Our aim is to get you better and feeling closer, more intimate, and emotionally safe. With that comes results-driven therapy, which in turn fosters confidence. Those ingredients tend to run contrary to endless therapy.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Absolutely. Infidelity, though hugely painful and upsetting, is something that about 80% of couples who experience it recover from and repair. Couples need four ingredients to do that: 1. End the affair completely. 2. Be willing to talk and admit your mistake. 3. Listen to and express real and repeated empathy for your partner&rsquo;s feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger. 4. Be willing to look at what the larger issue is in the relationship that led to the affair. We have seen many couples recover from infidelity and have helped them to navigate what the larger issues and patterns are in the relationship (often building years before the affair) in order to find a new and more fulfilling connection. Ideally, an affair is an opportunity for the relationship to be re-born on different terms and with new self-awareness for each partner.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>We are all about you asking questions and us as therapists being clear about what we are doing and the science behind it. That way you can understand where we are headed, how, and why. We want you to feel comfortable and knowledgable about what is happening in our work together &ndash; that way, you will also feel safer and be more willing to drop in to the emotional risk-taking that is necessary for deep change. True vulnerability can be challenging and you need to feel safe and clear about why you are being asked to take emotional risks with your partner. We have a practical as well as emotional approach that is just the right amount of each and makes couples confident about where we are going and why as well as how to continue to get there after the therapy has ended.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, we have similar outcomes with online therapy as in person. If anything, online can have better results because couples are able to be present for sessions more regularly whereas before, they may have had to miss sessions frequently which greatly impedes progress. Now couples are not putting off couples therapy for as long because they know that they can access it conveniently, easily, and from the comfort of their own home.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Sometimes and yes, if you request it.&nbsp;<a href="https://lovefrontiertherapy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy</a>&nbsp;is not considered a &lsquo;tool-based&rsquo; therapy. Some types of therapy like Solution-Focused or CBT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) are more about giving suggestions and cognitive-based tools. In our experience and training, this is not deep enough. The way to truly shift patterns is by letting the therapist guide you towards profound emotional risk-taking with your partner in the sessions. This can shift your neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. After the experiential work we do in the therapy, we often meta (cognitive) process in order to &lsquo;bake in&rsquo; what we just did. Homework is really just about enjoying the closeness and traction you are working on in the therapy and continuing to create situations that build trust and closeness.&nbsp;</p>
