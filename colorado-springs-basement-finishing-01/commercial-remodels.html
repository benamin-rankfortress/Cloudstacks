"@type": "Answer",
"text": "


&nbsp;




Kitchen remodels are one of the most popular, and also the most satisfying remodeling projects one can perform for their home. Not only will it create a more compelling and welcoming central location for your home, but it will also update your home and increase the resale value, should you ever decide to sell the property. The cost for kitchen remodeling can vary wildly, depending on many different factors like the appliances, counter top materials and more.

HomeAdvisor has valued the average kitchen remodel to fall somewhere between $12,567 and $34,962. A small kitchen remodel can cost as little as $4,000, while a more lavish and upscale remodel can exceed $50,000.

In its annual Cost vs. Value report for 2019,&nbsp;Remodeling Magazine&nbsp;puts the national average for a midrange major kitchen remodel at $66,196 and an upscale major kitchen remodel at $131,510. These costs can vary depending on what region of the United States you live in, as well as whether you live in a rural or major metropolitan area.

Part of determining the amount it will cost to remodel a kitchen in your home will depend entirely on the extent of the makeover. One of the most significant costs during a kitchen renovation project will be cabinets, as they are known to consume around 25% of a kitchen remodel budget. There are many options available for a budget friendly course of action, such as preserving some of the budget by purchasing Ikea cabinets, or buying a nicer faucet while spending less on the actual sink you decide to install.

Experts also recommend setting aside around 20% of your budget for unexpected surprises that can arise during the kitchen remodeling process. Often times, during the demo process, unknown issues may come to light such as water damage or electrical issues that are not up to code. It is a good idea to prepare for these types of hurdles by setting aside a portion of your budget dedicated to handling these types of issues, in case they do arise."

Yes. Although it does not add square footage to the overall size of your home, prospective buyers love to see a finished basement when they are in the market to buy. This helps add usable space for things like family gatherings, additional sleeping arrangements, or even additional room for kids to play, inevitably increasing the overall value of your home. Finishing a basement in Colorado Springs will help increase the value of your home when it comes time to sell, if that should be an option. Most home buyers are looking to utilize as much space as possible, so transforming a dark and dreary unfinished basement into a warm, welcoming space for people to gather and feel comfortable in is going to drastically improve the chances that your home sells, while increasing the overall amount your home can be appraised for when it is put on the market.

<p>Lighting - Proper lighting is important in any room, and the basement is no exception. You need to have sufficient lighting to see what you're doing and make the space look bigger. You can install pot lights or track lighting to brighten up the space. In addition, you can also add a light well to bring in natural light from outside. If you have a small window in your basement, then you can install a sun tunnel to bring in more light.</p><p>Install Internet and Phone Lines</p><p>If you are planning to use your basement as a home office or a playroom for your kids, then you need to make sure that you have enough outlets for your computers, printers, and other devices. In addition, you will also need a phone line if you are going to use your basement as a home office. You can either install the outlets and phone lines yourself or hire an electrician to do it for you.</p><p>Complete basement finishing in Colorado Springs</p></div>

<div><p>Consider basement lighting</p><p>One of the best ways to brighten up a dreary basement is to let in some natural light. If you're planning a basement renovation, be sure to factor in windows and doors that will let in sunlight. Not only will this make your basement feel more inviting, but it can also help to reduce your energy costs.</p><p>Just be sure to cut the openings for your windows and doors before beginning any other work, and seal off the rest of the house to protect it from the dust. Also, be sure to consult with a general contractor professional to make sure that your walls can support the increased structural load of the new openings. With a little planning, you can transform your dark basement into a bright and welcoming space.</p><p>Installing egress windows in a basement</p></div>

<div> <p>One of the first things to consider when finishing a basement is how you will create access to the space. Many basements are accessed via a set of stairs, so it is important to make sure that these stairs are safe and stylish. One way to do this is to install handrails. Egress windows are also a requirement for basements in Colorado Springs. An egress window is a window that is large enough to serve as an emergency exit in case of fire or other emergencies. These windows must be installed according to the building code, so be sure to consult with a general contractor before adding one to your basement.</p><p>How to prevent moisture in a basement</p><p>In order to prevent moisture in a finished basement, it is essential to take steps to ensure good drainage off the roof and away from the foundation, provide adequate ventilation of bathrooms and kitchens to the outside, and avoid opening windows during humid months. Along with breathable insulation, a vapor retardant should be installed between interior stud walls and floors and between foundation walls and floor slabs. By taking these precautions, you can minimize the risk of moisture damage to your home. Though a dehumidifier may seem like the simplest solution to issues of moisture in a basement, it is important to be aware of the potential consequences of such an installation. Dehumidifiers work by drawing water out of the air and into the unit, where it is then collected and eventually drains out.</p><p>What type of flooring is best for basements?</p></div>

<div> <p>When finishing a basement, one of the most important choices is the type of flooring to use. Not all types of flooring can withstand the conditions in a basement, which can include higher levels of humidity and temperature fluctuations.</p><p>Solid wood flooring is one example of a material that should not be used in a basement; even small changes in moisture levels can cause the wood to buckle and split. Instead, look for materials such as vinyl planks, ceramic tile, and engineered wood flooring that can be used below grade without being damaged by the conditions. With so many options available, there is no need to sacrifice style for durability when choosing to floor for your basement.</p><p>Installing a heater in your basement</p><p>If you plan to use your basement as a living space, then you will need to install a heating system. This is not a project to be taken lightly; improper installation of a heating system can lead to serious problems such as carbon monoxide poisoning. That is why it is best to be left to professional contractors.</p> </div>

Not only will it create a more compelling and welcoming central location for your home, but it will also update your home and increase the resale value, should you ever decide to sell the property. The cost for kitchen remodeling can vary wildly, depending on many different factors like the appliances, counter top materials and more.</font><br />
<br />
<span style="color:#000000">HomeAdvisor has valued the average kitchen remodel to fall somewhere between $12,567 and $34,962. A small kitchen remodel can cost as little as $4,000, while a more lavish and upscale remodel can exceed $50,000.</span><br />
<br />
<font color="#000000">In its annual Cost vs. Value report for 2019,&nbsp;<em style="position:relative">Remodeling Magazine</em>&nbsp;puts the national average for a midrange major kitchen remodel at $66,196 and an upscale major kitchen remodel at $131,510. These costs can vary depending on what region of the United States you live in, as well as whether you live in a rural or major metropolitan area.<br />
<br />
Part of determining the amount it will cost to remodel a kitchen in your home will depend entirely on the extent of the makeover. One of the most significant costs during a kitchen renovation project will be cabinets, as they are known to consume around 25% of a kitchen remodel budget. There are many options available for a budget friendly course of action, such as preserving some of the budget by purchasing Ikea cabinets, or buying a nicer faucet while spending less on the actual sink you decide to install.<br />
<br />
Experts also recommend setting aside around 20% of your budget for unexpected surprises that can arise during the kitchen remodeling process.
