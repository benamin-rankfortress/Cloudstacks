}

"@type": "Question","name": "Which SEO partner is right for your agency?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Choosing a SEO partner can be a difficult task for any agency. You want to choose a partner that can deliver those results with maximum ease. Metrics are a big part of your analytics and reporting, and it is important to have the right metrics and success analyzers, which will allow you to report the best results to your clients.&nbsp; It is especially important to have a reporting system that will work for your business by providing you with data that is not only accurate but also supports your deliverables.

You are highly competent in your industry. You provide quality services, your customers are happy, and you are crushing it. But there is one thing you are lacking &ndash; fully staffed marketing expertise. You do not have the time or money to market your products or services on the internet, which is where 85% of customers start their purchase journey. That&rsquo;s where SEO resellers come in.

SEO partners who have extensive experience and excellent track record of communication do not come around that often. That is why we at Affordable SEO believe that these qualities combined with comprehensive knowledge about working on different platforms, like website auditing and analysis, truly make a great SEO reseller. Prior to hiring any SEO agency or consulting company, make sure they have an excellent record of communication and reporting during the project. It is important for the SEO reseller to be interested in connecting you and thus making a close connection. Do not hesitate to ask your potential partner for references of their customers."

<p>Technical SEO helps keep your site’s content unique and avoids duplication. Duplicate content signals that your website is unfocused and competing with itself. It forces you to focus on specific keywords and avoid duplicity. By avoiding duplicate content, you will improve your search engine ranking. You can also keep content unique across multiple pages by avoiding keyword cannibalization.</p><p>While technical SEO focuses on the technical aspects of your website, content SEO focuses on optimizing the content itself. This means using keywords and phrases that are relevant to the target audience. Technical SEO can help your website rank well in search results, while content SEO is the act of creating content that catches the attention of users and attracts traffic. Often, these two techniques work hand in hand, generating more traffic for your site.</p><p>Content SEO is often faster and more effective than technical SEO, as it can also gain traction across other channels and support your branding efforts. In addition, content marketing can be a part of your SEO budget, and can be used to supplement paid social promotion, email marketing, and directing in-store clients to your website’s content.</p></div>

<div> <p>Is SEO a technical marketing? - SEO is a type of marketing that involves the use of various strategies, tactics, and techniques to increase a website’s ranking and visibility. The right techniques can boost a website’s reach and conversions. The marketing team or business owner must determine which techniques will work best for their website. For example, they might decide to focus on technical SEO instead of content marketing. Technical SEO involves optimizing your website’s setup and code, which allows search engines and humans to read it properly.</p><p>Another technique in SEO is to implement SSL to secure your website. The use of SSL is essential for your website, and Google has provided guidelines on how to implement SSL on your site. Additionally, issues with organization, navigation, and internal linking can negatively impact a website’s search rankings. Moreover, some websites produce multiple versions of the same page, which is considered spam by search engines. Duplicate headers and title tags also impact search rankings. Typically, these errors are not spotted in a page-level analysis, but they should be checked during the technical analysis.</p><p>Another benefit of technical SEO is improving the website’s accessibility. A site that is well-optimized for search engines will load faster, and users will have a better experience. It will also have better security. When users are using mobile devices, they don’t want to be forced to wait for pages to load. This means that it’s vital to ensure that your site is optimized for mobile devices as well.</p></div>

The goal is to improve the quality of your content, which in turn improves the amount of traffic you receive from search engines.</p><p>SEO professionals use a mix of internal and external tactics to improve a website’s ranking in search engines. For example, on-page & GMB SEO experts focuses on the content on your website’s pages, while off-page SEO concentrates on the links that direct visitors to your site from other websites. These links are known as “backlinks,” and they help you build trust with search algorithms.</p><p>SEO practices are used by many businesses to manipulate search engine results. Links are one of the main factors used to determine a site’s ranking, as they are seen as votes of quality from other websites. No one will link to a low-quality site, so websites that get lots of links will tend to be more authoritative in search engines.</p></div>

<div><p>Moreover, SEO is becoming more complicated as technology and the Martech landscape continues to grow. CMOs spend about $12 billion a year on martech, and the number is expected to rise to $120 billion within a decade. With the growing importance of search, brands have begun to prioritize search as a top priority. According to Borrell Associates, brand marketers will invest $80 billion in SEO technologies by 2020.</p><p>SEO Tools & Insights for technical seo - The toolset for technical SEO is vast and covers many different topics. It is important to view this role as a separate role from the rest of your SEO arsenal. Websites have become increasingly interactive and complex, creating challenges for indexation and rendering. Consumer behavior is also changing towards other devices. While mobile devices were a revolution for a few years, the next one will be voice search.</p><p>Technical SEO is an important aspect of search engine optimization. It involves understanding how search engines crawl a website and how to optimize it for them. Search engines can penalize websites with technical problems, causing a reduction in traffic and rankings. You can learn all about technical SEO by following a Beginner’s guide to technical SEO.</p></div>

<div> <p>How to Get High Quality Backlinks - There are a variety of techniques you can use to build high-quality backlinks for your website. You can use content formats that have been proven to generate links, use brand mentions to generate links, and become a source for reporters and bloggers.</p><p>Become a Source For Reporters and Bloggers - A recent survey by marketing firm Brodeur indicates that more than 70% of North American journalists consider blogs to be a regular source of story ideas. In addition, a survey by the New York Times found that social media plays an important role in getting a story picked up by the mainstream media. Indeed, many journalists are now using Twitter and Facebook as newsrooms. While the idea of generating interest in your business through these social networks may sound like a no-brainer, the results of this research indicate that you may need to put some thought into your strategy.</p><p>The best way to do this is to create a blog that is regularly updated with fresh content. This is a great opportunity for you to show off your knowledge of your industry. Additionally, you could even get in on the action by partnering with a local radio show to sponsor their health and wellness program. Getting in on the newsmaking is an obvious way to boost your brand, and it is a good way to nab some press.</p></div>

<div> <p>Publish “Skyscraper” Content - One of the simplest and most effective ways to get your content known is through link building. However, getting high-quality backlinks can be a challenge. This is where the Skyscraper Technique comes into play. It involves finding content that ranks in the top 10 in your niche. Then, figuring out how to replicate it. In this way, you can increase your page rank and drive more traffic to your site.</p><p>To do this, you will need to spend some time and money. But, the reward is worth it. You will be amazed at the results. Getting a quality backlink is the most important thing you can do to improve your website’s ranking. Fortunately, there are several tools to help you out. These include SEMrush, Majic, and Ahrefs.</p><p>While these are good for identifying potential skyscraper content, the best way to find these types of sites is to use a tool like Site Explorer. If you do not have access to such a tool, you can always perform a quick Google search. Similarly, you can use the same technique to discover relevant blogs and websites with a ton of backlinks.</p> </div>

<div><p>Build Links From Outdated Resources - Having good backlinks is vital for SEO. If you want to be ranked high on the SERPs, you will need links from authority sites. In order to get those links, you need to have relationships with good websites and create content that is linkable. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways you can build quality backlinks.</p><p>One of the easiest and quickest ways to build quality backlinks is through thought leadership. This involves being an expert in your field and continuing to educate people in the industry. You can do this by writing articles, conducting surveys, or creating informational hubs with relevant statistics. Once you have gained a following, you will start to get links from other websites.</p><p>Another method is to contact the author of a resource page and ask them to link to your site. These pages can be a great source of exposure, but you need to be careful. The owner of the resource page wants to make sure you don’t send users to a shady website. They will check the content on your website, as well as your traffic.</p></div>
