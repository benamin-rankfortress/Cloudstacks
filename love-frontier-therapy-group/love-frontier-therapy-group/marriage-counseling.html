"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We are getting at the root of what you and your partner&rsquo;s issues are. What is keeping you feeling disconnected? What emotional patterns keep happening over and over again? We&rsquo;re not looking to give you some tools and put a band-aid on it, or talk endlessly about your childhood. We are also not going for blaming, diagnosing, or pathologizing anyone. The therapist works&nbsp;to get into the moment of what is happening between you, while interrupting that negative pattern and encouraging&nbsp;vulnerability. This can lead to breakthroughs about what has been keeping you stuck and disconnected. Together in the session, we work to help get you &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; directly and clearly, while afterwards cultivating a coherent understanding of what just happened, why it did, and how to keep doing it."

"@type": "Question","name": "Why is couples therapy expensive?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy is a very intense type of therapy, our therapists are highly trained and skilled, and it&rsquo;s results-driven (meaning our objective is to get timely, tangible results). The therapy is weekly and considered shorter term (4-12 months on average). The therapist and couple work hard, with the clinician extremely engaged. Like this, we get down to business right away in a no-nonsense way. There is no time wasted, no unnecessary nodding or history-gathering on the part of the therapist. In the end what you spend on a good EFCT therapist can be quite a bit less than you would spend in a mediocre therapy situation that can last several years with lukewarm results."

As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why is Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy considered short-term?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Because we work towards making deep changes quickly. We don&rsquo;t waste your time by letting you have arguments during the session that you were already having at home. We don&rsquo;t just sit there, taking notes and vaguely nodding. We are actively engaged, with a clear direction, agenda, and goals &ndash; all the while teaching you skills to use at home on your own. Our aim is to get you better and feeling closer, more intimate, and emotionally safe. With that comes results-driven therapy, which in turn fosters confidence. Those ingredients tend to run contrary to endless therapy."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Will you give us tools and homework?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Sometimes and yes, if you request it.&nbsp;Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&nbsp;is not considered a &lsquo;tool-based&rsquo; therapy. Some types of therapy like Solution-Focused or CBT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) are more about giving suggestions and cognitive-based tools. In our experience and training, this is not deep enough. The way to truly shift patterns is by letting the therapist guide you towards profound emotional risk-taking with your partner in the sessions. This can shift your neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. After the experiential work we do in the therapy, we often meta (cognitive) process in order to &lsquo;bake in&rsquo; what we just did. Homework is really just about enjoying the closeness and traction you are working on in the therapy and continuing to create situations that build trust and closeness.&nbsp;"

<p>Importance of Family Physical Therapy - In the hustle and bustle of daily life, it’s easy to overlook the critical role that a healthy lifestyle plays in the overall well-being of families. The adage “health is wealth” takes on a new dimension when we consider the collective vitality of a family unit. This blog explores the transformative importance of Family Physical Therapy, a dynamic approach that goes beyond individual health, promoting the harmonious well-being of the entire family.</p><p>Holistic Family Wellness - Family physical therapy stands as a beacon for holistic wellness. It encompasses not only the physical health of each family member but also nurtures emotional and mental well-being. This holistic perspective addresses the interconnectedness of health elements, fostering a balanced and thriving family dynamic.</p><p>Strengthening Family Bonds - Engaging in physical therapy as a family creates shared experiences that strengthen bonds.

<div><p>Making Family Physical Therapy A Lifestyle - The concept of family physical therapy emerges as a beacon of transformative well-being. Beyond sporadic sessions, the true power of family physical therapy lies in its integration into daily life — a seamless transition from a routine to a lifestyle. Let’s explore the critical strategies for making family physical therapy a sustainable and enriching part of your family’s everyday existence.</p><p>Integration into Daily Routines: The first step towards making family physical therapy a lifestyle is seamlessly incorporating it into daily routines. Designate specific times for physical activities that suit the family’s schedule. Consistency is critical to establishing a lasting routine, whether morning stretches, post-dinner walks, or weekend workouts.</p><p>Family-Friendly Activities: To ensure family members remain engaged and enthusiastic, choose activities that appeal to everyone. This could be anything from family hikes, bike rides, or even dance parties in the living room. The goal is to make physical activity enjoyable, fostering a positive association that encourages long-term participation.</p></div>

<div> <p>Setting Realistic and Attainable Goals: Define clear and realistic health goals as a family. These could range from increasing daily step counts to achieving specific fitness milestones. Setting collective goals promotes a sense of shared achievement and motivates family members to work together towards a common objective.</p><p>Cultivating a Health-Conscious Environment: Transform your living space into a health-conscious haven. Stock the kitchen with nutritious foods, create a dedicated workout area, and encourage open discussions about health and well-being. This environment is a constant reminder of the family’s commitment to a healthier lifestyle.</p><p>Embracing Nutritional Wellness: A holistic approach to family physical therapy extends beyond exercise to encompass nutritional wellness. Make meal planning and preparation a family affair, emphasizing the importance of balanced nutrition. The family collectively makes healthier food choices and reinforces the overall well-being ethos.</p></div>

<div> <p>Adapting to Changing Needs: As family dynamics evolve, so should the approach to family physical therapy. Be flexible and adapt routines and activities to accommodate changing needs and schedules. This adaptability ensures family physical therapy remains a dynamic and sustainable lifestyle choice.</p><p>Creating a Supportive Network: Create a family support network to overcome challenges and celebrate successes, fostering teamwork and a healthy lifestyle by providing emotional reinforcement and a sense of belonging.</p><p>Making family physical therapy a lifestyle is about weaving wellness into the fabric of daily life. By embracing this holistic approach and committing to sustainable practices, families can create a foundation for enduring health and happiness. It’s not just about the exercises; it’s about building a lifestyle that nurtures well-being, unity, and the collective pursuit of a healthier, happier tomorrow.</p> </div>

<div class="card-body"><p>We are getting at the root of what you and your partner&rsquo;s issues are. What is keeping you feeling disconnected? What emotional patterns keep happening over and over again? We&rsquo;re not looking to give you some tools and put a band-aid on it, or talk endlessly about your childhood. We are also not going for blaming, diagnosing, or pathologizing anyone. The therapist works&nbsp;to get into the moment of what is happening between you, while interrupting that negative pattern and encouraging&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vulnerability</a>. This can lead to breakthroughs about what has been keeping you stuck and disconnected. Together in the session, we work to help get you &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; directly and clearly, while afterwards cultivating a coherent understanding of what just happened, why it did, and how to keep doing it.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy is a very intense type of therapy, our therapists are highly trained and skilled, and it&rsquo;s results-driven (meaning our objective is to get timely, tangible results). The therapy is weekly and considered shorter term (4-12 months on average). The therapist and couple work hard, with the clinician extremely engaged. Like this, we get down to business right away in a no-nonsense way. There is no time wasted, no unnecessary nodding or history-gathering on the part of the therapist. In the end what you spend on a good EFCT therapist can be quite a bit less than you would spend in a mediocre therapy situation that can last several years with lukewarm results.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Our focus at Love Frontier is to provide you with therapists who have superior training and skill as well as an open, relaxed style of therapy. As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Because we work towards making deep changes quickly. We don&rsquo;t waste your time by letting you have arguments during the session that you were already having at home. We don&rsquo;t just sit there, taking notes and vaguely nodding. We are actively engaged, with a clear direction, agenda, and goals &ndash; all the while teaching you skills to use at home on your own. Our aim is to get you better and feeling closer, more intimate, and emotionally safe. With that comes results-driven therapy, which in turn fosters confidence. Those ingredients tend to run contrary to endless therapy.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Sometimes and yes, if you request it.&nbsp;<a href="https://lovefrontiertherapy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy</a>&nbsp;is not considered a &lsquo;tool-based&rsquo; therapy. Some types of therapy like Solution-Focused or CBT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) are more about giving suggestions and cognitive-based tools. In our experience and training, this is not deep enough. The way to truly shift patterns is by letting the therapist guide you towards profound emotional risk-taking with your partner in the sessions. This can shift your neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. After the experiential work we do in the therapy, we often meta (cognitive) process in order to &lsquo;bake in&rsquo; what we just did. Homework is really just about enjoying the closeness and traction you are working on in the therapy and continuing to create situations that build trust and closeness.&nbsp;</p>
