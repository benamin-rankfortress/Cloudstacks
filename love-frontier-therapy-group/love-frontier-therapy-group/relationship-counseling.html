"@type": "Question","name": "We have felt disconnected for years and I don’t know if I even want to stay married, how can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is it possible to recover from infidelity and how is it done?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Absolutely. Infidelity, though hugely painful and upsetting, is something that about 80% of couples who experience it recover from and repair. Couples need four ingredients to do that: 1. End the affair completely. 2. Be willing to talk and admit your mistake. 3. Listen to and express real and repeated empathy for your partner&rsquo;s feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger. 4. Be willing to look at what the larger issue is in the relationship that led to the affair. We have seen many couples recover from infidelity and have helped them to navigate what the larger issues and patterns are in the relationship (often building years before the affair) in order to find a new and more fulfilling connection. Ideally, an affair is an opportunity for the relationship to be re-born on different terms and with new self-awareness for each partner."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do couples face problems, what normally leads them to couples therapy, and how does it work?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We have a lot of trouble getting on the same page in parenting our kids, can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This is a very common issue. It&rsquo;s really helpful to unpack what has lead to conflict in the parenting realm and how you handle differences with each-other. You don&rsquo;t have to have the exact same parenting values at all times (this would be impossible anyway!) in order to find connection and common ground in parenting. Ultimately, if you are able to slow down and listen to one-another repeatedly around parenting differences, you can learn from your partner&rsquo;s style and influence each-other in positive ways. In EFCT, we work to uncover the negative emotional patterns and old triggers that can hijack you around parenting differences. That way, we can begin to clear the way towards real listening and learning rather than the tendency to try and control or change one-another&rsquo;s parenting."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We’ve had some bad experiences in the past with therapists, how will this be different?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body."

<p>Personalized Therapeutic Approaches - As our understanding of individual differences deepens, the future of EFT is likely to witness a surge in personalized therapeutic approaches. Tailoring interventions based on an individual’s unique emotional makeup, attachment style, and life experiences could amplify the efficacy of EFT, leading to more targeted and efficient outcomes.</p><p>Interdisciplinary Collaborations - The intersection of EFT with other therapeutic modalities and disciplines holds promise for a more holistic approach to emotional well-being. Collaborations with neuroscience, positive psychology, and even art and music therapy could provide a multifaceted toolkit for therapists and clients, enriching the therapeutic landscape.</p><p>Cultural Sensitivity and Inclusivity - The future of EFT also involves a commitment to cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. Recognizing and addressing the diverse ways emotions are expressed and experienced across cultures is essential to ensure that EFT remains relevant and globally practical.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Absolutely. Infidelity, though hugely painful and upsetting, is something that about 80% of couples who experience it recover from and repair. Couples need four ingredients to do that: 1. End the affair completely. 2. Be willing to talk and admit your mistake. 3. Listen to and express real and repeated empathy for your partner&rsquo;s feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger. 4. Be willing to look at what the larger issue is in the relationship that led to the affair. We have seen many couples recover from infidelity and have helped them to navigate what the larger issues and patterns are in the relationship (often building years before the affair) in order to find a new and more fulfilling connection. Ideally, an affair is an opportunity for the relationship to be re-born on different terms and with new self-awareness for each partner.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This is a very common issue. It&rsquo;s really helpful to unpack what has lead to conflict in the parenting realm and how you handle differences with each-other. You don&rsquo;t have to have the exact same parenting values at all times (this would be impossible anyway!) in order to find connection and common ground in parenting. Ultimately, if you are able to slow down and listen to one-another repeatedly around parenting differences, you can learn from your partner&rsquo;s style and influence each-other in positive ways. In EFCT, we work to uncover the negative emotional patterns and old triggers that can hijack you around parenting differences. That way, we can begin to clear the way towards real listening and learning rather than the tendency to try and control or change one-another&rsquo;s parenting.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body.</p>
