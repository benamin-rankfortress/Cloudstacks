<meta name="description" content="Couples often get stuck in difficult repeating patterns that can be hard to get out of, much less slow down. They feel disconnecting and lonely. And the patterns can seem to take over in times of transition or stress. We are here to help you unlock stuck patterns of communication and set you free to become more connected, close, resilient and loved. All of our therapists have either certification in or advanced level training in Emotionally Focused Therapy. EFT is attachment based and research-backed and is one of the most effective couples therapy approaches because it gets at the root of the problem and helps heal relationship patterns for good.">

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We are getting at the root of what you and your partner&rsquo;s issues are. What is keeping you feeling disconnected? What emotional patterns keep happening over and over again? We&rsquo;re not looking to give you some tools and put a band-aid on it, or talk endlessly about your childhood. We are also not going for blaming, diagnosing, or pathologizing anyone. The therapist works&nbsp;to get into the moment of what is happening between you, while interrupting that negative pattern and encouraging&nbsp;vulnerability. This can lead to breakthroughs about what has been keeping you stuck and disconnected. Together in the session, we work to help get you &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; directly and clearly, while afterwards cultivating a coherent understanding of what just happened, why it did, and how to keep doing it."

"@type": "Question","name": "Why is couples therapy expensive?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy is a very intense type of therapy, our therapists are highly trained and skilled, and it&rsquo;s results-driven (meaning our objective is to get timely, tangible results). The therapy is weekly and considered shorter term (4-12 months on average). The therapist and couple work hard, with the clinician extremely engaged. Like this, we get down to business right away in a no-nonsense way. There is no time wasted, no unnecessary nodding or history-gathering on the part of the therapist. In the end what you spend on a good EFCT therapist can be quite a bit less than you would spend in a mediocre therapy situation that can last several years with lukewarm results."

As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why is Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy considered short-term?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Because we work towards making deep changes quickly. We don&rsquo;t waste your time by letting you have arguments during the session that you were already having at home. We don&rsquo;t just sit there, taking notes and vaguely nodding. We are actively engaged, with a clear direction, agenda, and goals &ndash; all the while teaching you skills to use at home on your own. Our aim is to get you better and feeling closer, more intimate, and emotionally safe. With that comes results-driven therapy, which in turn fosters confidence. Those ingredients tend to run contrary to endless therapy."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Will you give us tools and homework?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Sometimes and yes, if you request it.&nbsp;Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&nbsp;is not considered a &lsquo;tool-based&rsquo; therapy. Some types of therapy like Solution-Focused or CBT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) are more about giving suggestions and cognitive-based tools. In our experience and training, this is not deep enough. The way to truly shift patterns is by letting the therapist guide you towards profound emotional risk-taking with your partner in the sessions. This can shift your neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. After the experiential work we do in the therapy, we often meta (cognitive) process in order to &lsquo;bake in&rsquo; what we just did. Homework is really just about enjoying the closeness and traction you are working on in the therapy and continuing to create situations that build trust and closeness.&nbsp;"

They serve as a universal language, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers. Shared emotional experiences foster empathy, cooperation, and communal bonds. The social aspect of emotions is a crucial element in human evolution and societal cohesion.</p><p>Emotional Intelligence - Acknowledging and understanding one’s emotions is a vital aspect of emotional intelligence. This cognitive ability empowers individuals to navigate social complexities, manage stress, and foster healthier relationships.

<h3 class="t945083be6f43d0bbe42c1fc95b7a05df mt-2" id=""></h3>
<div><p>Emotion Awareness and Expression: A fundamental pillar of EFT is the cultivation of emotion awareness. Couples are encouraged to identify, articulate, and express their emotions openly. This technique serves as a powerful catalyst for self-discovery and mutual understanding, paving the way for a more authentic connection.</p><p>Restructuring Negative Interaction Cycles: EFT recognizes the destructive power of negative interaction cycles within relationships. Couples work collaboratively to identify and deconstruct these patterns. By interrupting and restructuring these cycles, EFT aims to replace conflict and withdrawal with healthier communication and connection.</p><p>Creating New Bonds Through Positive Interactions: EFT is not just about addressing negatives; it’s about building positives. Couples engage in exercises and activities that promote positive interactions and create new patterns. These may include shared experiences, expressions of appreciation, or small gestures that contribute to the overall atmosphere of emotional connection.</p></div>

<div><p>Promoting Acceptance and Validation: An essential facet of EFT involves creating a safe space for each partner to express themselves without judgment. Validation becomes a powerful tool, fostering a sense of acceptance and understanding. This technique helps partners feel heard, seen, and valued, contributing to the establishment of a secure emotional bond.</p><p>The Softening Conversation: EFT introduces a unique conversational style called the “softening conversation.” This technique involves expressing vulnerable emotions and needs in a way that invites empathy and support from the partner. Couples can engage in more open and constructive dialogues by fostering a climate of emotional safety.</p><p>Consolidation and Integration: The final phase of EFT involves consolidating the gains made throughout the therapeutic process. Couples reflect on their journey, solidifying their newfound emotional bonds and communication skills. This phase aims to equip couples with the tools and insights to navigate future challenges independently.</p></div>

<div class="card-body"><p>We are getting at the root of what you and your partner&rsquo;s issues are. What is keeping you feeling disconnected? What emotional patterns keep happening over and over again? We&rsquo;re not looking to give you some tools and put a band-aid on it, or talk endlessly about your childhood. We are also not going for blaming, diagnosing, or pathologizing anyone. The therapist works&nbsp;to get into the moment of what is happening between you, while interrupting that negative pattern and encouraging&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vulnerability</a>. This can lead to breakthroughs about what has been keeping you stuck and disconnected. Together in the session, we work to help get you &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; directly and clearly, while afterwards cultivating a coherent understanding of what just happened, why it did, and how to keep doing it.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Emotionally Focused Couple Therapy is a very intense type of therapy, our therapists are highly trained and skilled, and it&rsquo;s results-driven (meaning our objective is to get timely, tangible results). The therapy is weekly and considered shorter term (4-12 months on average). The therapist and couple work hard, with the clinician extremely engaged. Like this, we get down to business right away in a no-nonsense way. There is no time wasted, no unnecessary nodding or history-gathering on the part of the therapist. In the end what you spend on a good EFCT therapist can be quite a bit less than you would spend in a mediocre therapy situation that can last several years with lukewarm results.</p>

As therapists, we are human, and not trying present in a stiff or superior manner. We strive to create a safe, comfortable environment for you as a couple to make the deepest changes possible. This is not only because of our training in the attachment-based model (EFCT) and specialty in couples therapy, but also the non-pathologizing emotional comfort and safety that we strive to create.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Because we work towards making deep changes quickly. We don&rsquo;t waste your time by letting you have arguments during the session that you were already having at home. We don&rsquo;t just sit there, taking notes and vaguely nodding. We are actively engaged, with a clear direction, agenda, and goals &ndash; all the while teaching you skills to use at home on your own. Our aim is to get you better and feeling closer, more intimate, and emotionally safe. With that comes results-driven therapy, which in turn fosters confidence. Those ingredients tend to run contrary to endless therapy.</p>

<div class="card-body"><p>Sometimes and yes, if you request it.&nbsp;<a href="https://lovefrontiertherapy.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy</a>&nbsp;is not considered a &lsquo;tool-based&rsquo; therapy. Some types of therapy like Solution-Focused or CBT&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) are more about giving suggestions and cognitive-based tools. In our experience and training, this is not deep enough. The way to truly shift patterns is by letting the therapist guide you towards profound emotional risk-taking with your partner in the sessions. This can shift your neuro-pathways and create deep emotional bonding and change. After the experiential work we do in the therapy, we often meta (cognitive) process in order to &lsquo;bake in&rsquo; what we just did. Homework is really just about enjoying the closeness and traction you are working on in the therapy and continuing to create situations that build trust and closeness.&nbsp;</p>
