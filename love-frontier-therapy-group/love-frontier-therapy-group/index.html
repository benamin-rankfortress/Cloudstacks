<meta name="description" content="Couples often get stuck in difficult repeating patterns that can be hard to get out of, much less slow down. They feel disconnecting and lonely. And the patterns can seem to take over in times of transition or stress. We are here to help you unlock stuck patterns of communication and set you free to become more connected, close, resilient and loved. All of our therapists have either certification in or advanced level training in Emotionally Focused Therapy. EFT is attachment based and research-backed and is one of the most effective couples therapy approaches because it gets at the root of the problem and helps heal relationship patterns for good.">

"@type": "Question","name": "I’m worried about doing couples therapy because I’ve heard of a friend whose relationship ended afterwards.",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "I hear you. Fortunately, this type of couples therapy &ndash; Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&rsquo;s first agenda is to help you to feel closer, not let you disengage or shove all responsibility onto your partner. It&rsquo;s about understanding and turning around repetitive patterns while re-connecting you as a couple. By the end of the session, our goal is for you to feel closer and safer with each-other, not more disconnected. Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy has been proven to be highly effective &ndash; the American Psychological Association states that EFCT correlates with a 75% full recovery with 90% showing significant improvement in their relationship. The other 10% normally consists of physically abusive couples, and / or couples that are facing active addiction issues (In contrast, folks in addiction recovery often do very well with EFCT).&nbsp;&nbsp;In our practice, we are seeing very high success rates with couples who are motivated, committed, and open to doing the hard but rewarding work of therapy together.&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is a typical therapy session like?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "In the session, we will be actively helping you get to the bottom of how, when, and why you get hijacked by recurring patterns with your partner. The therapist works to help you to express the more vulnerable feelings (that you may have been unaware of) that drive reactivity. You are then coached and guided to share in a profound, vulnerable way with your partner, including what your deeper needs are for connection and attachment. Together, we help you to make sense of what just happened and how the negative pattern between you both has been self-reinforcing and what it&rsquo;s components are. EFCT is a perfect combination of deep emotional insight and sharing with a real meta-understanding of what is happening and how you were able to do something different together in real-time. Together, during the session, we are working to create new neuro-pathways of safe, bonding communication. These new pathways are powerful and can help you to learn how to increasingly break the negative patterns on your own."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How do we make sure we are making progress and staying on track with our goals?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We are all about you asking questions and us as therapists being clear about what we are doing and the science behind it. That way you can understand where we are headed, how, and why. We want you to feel comfortable and knowledgable about what is happening in our work together &ndash; that way, you will also feel safer and be more willing to drop in to the emotional risk-taking that is necessary for deep change. True vulnerability can be challenging and you need to feel safe and clear about why you are being asked to take emotional risks with your partner. We have a practical as well as emotional approach that is just the right amount of each and makes couples confident about where we are going and why as well as how to continue to get there after the therapy has ended."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Our sex life is pretty much nonexistent, can you help with that?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is online therapy as good as in person therapy?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, we have similar outcomes with online therapy as in person. If anything, online can have better results because couples are able to be present for sessions more regularly whereas before, they may have had to miss sessions frequently which greatly impedes progress. Now couples are not putting off couples therapy for as long because they know that they can access it conveniently, easily, and from the comfort of their own home."

<p>What Are Emotionally Focused Therapy Techniques Effective?</p><p>Understanding and navigating emotions play a pivotal role in the intricate dance of human relationships. Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) emerges as a beacon, offering a structured approach to cultivating emotional well-being within relationships. At its core, EFT techniques focus on the interplay of emotions, attachment, and relationship patterns. This blog delves into the essence of Emotionally Focused Therapy Techniques, unraveling the method’s potential to enhance emotional awareness, reshape negative cycles, and fortify attachment bonds. As we embark on this exploration, the underlying thread is the profound impact of EFT in fostering healthier, more fulfilling connections between individuals.</p><p>Understanding Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) - Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is a therapeutic approach that strongly emphasizes emotions and attachment theory. In EFT, therapists work with couples to help them understand their negative patterns and create new solutions. The clients’ therapeutic relationship and emotional experiences are prioritized in EFT.

<div> <p>The Science Behind Emotions - Emotions are the intricate symphony of human experience, shaping our perceptions, actions, and connections. Behind every smile, tear, or burst of laughter lies a complex interplay of neurobiology and psychology—the fascinating science behind emotions.</p><p>The Neurological Ballet - The brain’s intricate neural networks orchestrate emotions. The limbic system, often called the brain’s emotional center, plays a starring role. Regions like the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus collaborate to interpret and respond to stimuli, triggering the emotional rollercoaster we experience.</p><p>The Chemical Choreography - Neurotransmitters, the brain’s chemical messengers, are the dancers in this biological ballet. Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, among others, influence our mood and emotional states. The delicate balance of these neurotransmitters determines whether we feel joy, sadness, or a myriad of other emotions.</p></div>

Fear prompts us to escape from danger, love strengthens social bonds, and anger fuels the defense of oneself or loved ones. Understanding the evolutionary roots of emotions provides insights into their purpose and significance.</p><p>The Social Harmony - Emotions are the glue that binds societies together. They serve as a universal language, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers. Shared emotional experiences foster empathy, cooperation, and communal bonds. The social aspect of emotions is a crucial element in human evolution and societal cohesion.</p><p>Emotional Intelligence - Acknowledging and understanding one’s emotions is a vital aspect of emotional intelligence. This cognitive ability empowers individuals to navigate social complexities, manage stress, and foster healthier relationships. The science of emotional intelligence sheds light on how self-awareness and empathy contribute to personal and interpersonal success.</p><p><a class="x0b98ce0d814085fbe0ad63a4988d5c18" href="https://lovefrontiertherapy.com/">Couples Therapy</a></p>

<div> <p>Emotion Awareness and Expression: A fundamental pillar of EFT is the cultivation of emotion awareness. Couples are encouraged to identify, articulate, and express their emotions openly. This technique serves as a powerful catalyst for self-discovery and mutual understanding, paving the way for a more authentic connection.</p><p>Restructuring Negative Interaction Cycles: EFT recognizes the destructive power of negative interaction cycles within relationships. Couples work collaboratively to identify and deconstruct these patterns. By interrupting and restructuring these cycles, EFT aims to replace conflict and withdrawal with healthier communication and connection.</p><p>Creating New Bonds Through Positive Interactions: EFT is not just about addressing negatives; it’s about building positives. Couples engage in exercises and activities that promote positive interactions and create new patterns.

<div class="card-body"><p>I hear you. Fortunately, this type of couples therapy &ndash; Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&rsquo;s first agenda is to help you to feel closer, not let you disengage or shove all responsibility onto your partner. It&rsquo;s about understanding and turning around repetitive patterns while re-connecting you as a couple. By the end of the session, our goal is for you to feel closer and safer with each-other, not more disconnected. Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy has been proven to be highly effective &ndash; the American Psychological Association states that EFCT correlates with a 75% full recovery with 90% showing significant improvement in their relationship. The other 10% normally consists of physically abusive couples, and / or couples that are facing active addiction issues (In contrast, folks in addiction recovery often do very well with EFCT).&nbsp;&nbsp;In our practice, we are seeing very high success rates with couples who are motivated, committed, and open to doing the hard but rewarding work of therapy together.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>In the session, we will be actively helping you get to the bottom of how, when, and why you get hijacked by recurring patterns with your partner. The therapist works to help you to express the more vulnerable feelings (that you may have been unaware of) that drive reactivity. You are then coached and guided to share in a profound, vulnerable way with your partner, including what your deeper needs are for connection and attachment. Together, we help you to make sense of what just happened and how the negative pattern between you both has been self-reinforcing and what it&rsquo;s components are. EFCT is a perfect combination of deep emotional insight and sharing with a real meta-understanding of what is happening and how you were able to do something different together in real-time. Together, during the session, we are working to create new neuro-pathways of safe, bonding communication. These new pathways are powerful and can help you to learn how to increasingly break the negative patterns on your own.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>We are all about you asking questions and us as therapists being clear about what we are doing and the science behind it. That way you can understand where we are headed, how, and why. We want you to feel comfortable and knowledgable about what is happening in our work together &ndash; that way, you will also feel safer and be more willing to drop in to the emotional risk-taking that is necessary for deep change. True vulnerability can be challenging and you need to feel safe and clear about why you are being asked to take emotional risks with your partner. We have a practical as well as emotional approach that is just the right amount of each and makes couples confident about where we are going and why as well as how to continue to get there after the therapy has ended.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, we have similar outcomes with online therapy as in person. If anything, online can have better results because couples are able to be present for sessions more regularly whereas before, they may have had to miss sessions frequently which greatly impedes progress. Now couples are not putting off couples therapy for as long because they know that they can access it conveniently, easily, and from the comfort of their own home.</p>
