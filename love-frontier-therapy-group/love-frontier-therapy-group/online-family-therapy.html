<meta name="description" content="Couples often get stuck in difficult repeating patterns that can be hard to get out of, much less slow down. They feel disconnecting and lonely. And the patterns can seem to take over in times of transition or stress. We are here to help you unlock stuck patterns of communication and set you free to become more connected, close, resilient and loved. All of our therapists have either certification in or advanced level training in Emotionally Focused Therapy. EFT is attachment based and research-backed and is one of the most effective couples therapy approaches because it gets at the root of the problem and helps heal relationship patterns for good.">

"@type": "Question","name": "I’m worried about doing couples therapy because I’ve heard of a friend whose relationship ended afterwards.",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "I hear you. Fortunately, this type of couples therapy &ndash; Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&rsquo;s first agenda is to help you to feel closer, not let you disengage or shove all responsibility onto your partner. It&rsquo;s about understanding and turning around repetitive patterns while re-connecting you as a couple. By the end of the session, our goal is for you to feel closer and safer with each-other, not more disconnected. Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy has been proven to be highly effective &ndash; the American Psychological Association states that EFCT correlates with a 75% full recovery with 90% showing significant improvement in their relationship. The other 10% normally consists of physically abusive couples, and / or couples that are facing active addiction issues (In contrast, folks in addiction recovery often do very well with EFCT).&nbsp;&nbsp;In our practice, we are seeing very high success rates with couples who are motivated, committed, and open to doing the hard but rewarding work of therapy together.&nbsp;"
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "What is a typical therapy session like?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "In the session, we will be actively helping you get to the bottom of how, when, and why you get hijacked by recurring patterns with your partner. The therapist works to help you to express the more vulnerable feelings (that you may have been unaware of) that drive reactivity. You are then coached and guided to share in a profound, vulnerable way with your partner, including what your deeper needs are for connection and attachment. Together, we help you to make sense of what just happened and how the negative pattern between you both has been self-reinforcing and what it&rsquo;s components are. EFCT is a perfect combination of deep emotional insight and sharing with a real meta-understanding of what is happening and how you were able to do something different together in real-time. Together, during the session, we are working to create new neuro-pathways of safe, bonding communication. These new pathways are powerful and can help you to learn how to increasingly break the negative patterns on your own."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "How do we make sure we are making progress and staying on track with our goals?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "We are all about you asking questions and us as therapists being clear about what we are doing and the science behind it. That way you can understand where we are headed, how, and why. We want you to feel comfortable and knowledgable about what is happening in our work together &ndash; that way, you will also feel safer and be more willing to drop in to the emotional risk-taking that is necessary for deep change. True vulnerability can be challenging and you need to feel safe and clear about why you are being asked to take emotional risks with your partner. We have a practical as well as emotional approach that is just the right amount of each and makes couples confident about where we are going and why as well as how to continue to get there after the therapy has ended."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Our sex life is pretty much nonexistent, can you help with that?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is online therapy as good as in person therapy?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Yes, we have similar outcomes with online therapy as in person. If anything, online can have better results because couples are able to be present for sessions more regularly whereas before, they may have had to miss sessions frequently which greatly impedes progress. Now couples are not putting off couples therapy for as long because they know that they can access it conveniently, easily, and from the comfort of their own home."

<div class="card-body"><p>I hear you. Fortunately, this type of couples therapy &ndash; Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy&rsquo;s first agenda is to help you to feel closer, not let you disengage or shove all responsibility onto your partner. It&rsquo;s about understanding and turning around repetitive patterns while re-connecting you as a couple. By the end of the session, our goal is for you to feel closer and safer with each-other, not more disconnected. Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy has been proven to be highly effective &ndash; the American Psychological Association states that EFCT correlates with a 75% full recovery with 90% showing significant improvement in their relationship. The other 10% normally consists of physically abusive couples, and / or couples that are facing active addiction issues (In contrast, folks in addiction recovery often do very well with EFCT).&nbsp;&nbsp;In our practice, we are seeing very high success rates with couples who are motivated, committed, and open to doing the hard but rewarding work of therapy together.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>In the session, we will be actively helping you get to the bottom of how, when, and why you get hijacked by recurring patterns with your partner. The therapist works to help you to express the more vulnerable feelings (that you may have been unaware of) that drive reactivity. You are then coached and guided to share in a profound, vulnerable way with your partner, including what your deeper needs are for connection and attachment. Together, we help you to make sense of what just happened and how the negative pattern between you both has been self-reinforcing and what it&rsquo;s components are. EFCT is a perfect combination of deep emotional insight and sharing with a real meta-understanding of what is happening and how you were able to do something different together in real-time. Together, during the session, we are working to create new neuro-pathways of safe, bonding communication. These new pathways are powerful and can help you to learn how to increasingly break the negative patterns on your own.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>We are all about you asking questions and us as therapists being clear about what we are doing and the science behind it. That way you can understand where we are headed, how, and why. We want you to feel comfortable and knowledgable about what is happening in our work together &ndash; that way, you will also feel safer and be more willing to drop in to the emotional risk-taking that is necessary for deep change. True vulnerability can be challenging and you need to feel safe and clear about why you are being asked to take emotional risks with your partner. We have a practical as well as emotional approach that is just the right amount of each and makes couples confident about where we are going and why as well as how to continue to get there after the therapy has ended.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, since some of our therapists are sex therapists as well as couples therapists, we are trained in that area. It&rsquo;s really common for couples, especially who have been together for a while and / or have had kids recently, to unwittingly put their sex life on hold because they are too busy, exhausted, and overwhelmed to feel much desire. This is normal because parents today really have way too much on their plate. Unless you are prioritizing intimate time together regularly, sex often takes the back seat and a few months can turn into years. There are ways to help get that connection back through both sex and couples therapy. Since sex and intimacy are very important components of your relationship, counseling in that area will often help smooth out other areas of the relationship naturally.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Yes, we have similar outcomes with online therapy as in person. If anything, online can have better results because couples are able to be present for sessions more regularly whereas before, they may have had to miss sessions frequently which greatly impedes progress. Now couples are not putting off couples therapy for as long because they know that they can access it conveniently, easily, and from the comfort of their own home.</p>
