"@type": "Question","name": "We have felt disconnected for years and I don’t know if I even want to stay married, how can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Is it possible to recover from infidelity and how is it done?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Absolutely. Infidelity, though hugely painful and upsetting, is something that about 80% of couples who experience it recover from and repair. Couples need four ingredients to do that: 1. End the affair completely. 2. Be willing to talk and admit your mistake. 3. Listen to and express real and repeated empathy for your partner&rsquo;s feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger. 4. Be willing to look at what the larger issue is in the relationship that led to the affair. We have seen many couples recover from infidelity and have helped them to navigate what the larger issues and patterns are in the relationship (often building years before the affair) in order to find a new and more fulfilling connection. Ideally, an affair is an opportunity for the relationship to be re-born on different terms and with new self-awareness for each partner."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "Why do couples face problems, what normally leads them to couples therapy, and how does it work?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We have a lot of trouble getting on the same page in parenting our kids, can you help?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "This is a very common issue. It&rsquo;s really helpful to unpack what has lead to conflict in the parenting realm and how you handle differences with each-other. You don&rsquo;t have to have the exact same parenting values at all times (this would be impossible anyway!) in order to find connection and common ground in parenting. Ultimately, if you are able to slow down and listen to one-another repeatedly around parenting differences, you can learn from your partner&rsquo;s style and influence each-other in positive ways. In EFCT, we work to uncover the negative emotional patterns and old triggers that can hijack you around parenting differences. That way, we can begin to clear the way towards real listening and learning rather than the tendency to try and control or change one-another&rsquo;s parenting."
}
},{
"@type": "Question","name": "We’ve had some bad experiences in the past with therapists, how will this be different?",
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body."

<div> <p>What Are Emotionally Focused Therapy Techniques Effective?</p><p>Understanding and navigating emotions play a pivotal role in the intricate dance of human relationships. Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) emerges as a beacon, offering a structured approach to cultivating emotional well-being within relationships. At its core, EFT techniques focus on the interplay of emotions, attachment, and relationship patterns. This blog delves into the essence of Emotionally Focused Therapy Techniques, unraveling the method’s potential to enhance emotional awareness, reshape negative cycles, and fortify attachment bonds. As we embark on this exploration, the underlying thread is the profound impact of EFT in fostering healthier, more fulfilling connections between individuals.</p><p>Understanding Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) - Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is a therapeutic approach that strongly emphasizes emotions and attachment theory. In EFT, therapists work with couples to help them understand their negative patterns and create new solutions. The clients’ therapeutic relationship and emotional experiences are prioritized in EFT. This approach also aims to develop emotional awareness and intelligence in couples, enabling them to change unhealthy patterns and strengthen their emotional bonds. By focusing on the interpersonal interactions and with the therapist’s help, EFT helps couples navigate their difficulties and build healthier and more adaptive relationships.</p> </div>

<div><p>The Science Behind Emotions - Emotions are the intricate symphony of human experience, shaping our perceptions, actions, and connections. Behind every smile, tear, or burst of laughter lies a complex interplay of neurobiology and psychology—the fascinating science behind emotions.</p><p>The Neurological Ballet - The brain’s intricate neural networks orchestrate emotions. The limbic system, often called the brain’s emotional center, plays a starring role. Regions like the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus collaborate to interpret and respond to stimuli, triggering the emotional rollercoaster we experience.</p><p>The Chemical Choreography - Neurotransmitters, the brain’s chemical messengers, are the dancers in this biological ballet. Serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, among others, influence our mood and emotional states. The delicate balance of these neurotransmitters determines whether we feel joy, sadness, or a myriad of other emotions.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse0" aria-labelledby="heading0" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This comes up a lot and we often begin with Discernment Counseling, which encourages each member of the couple to really get clear on what issues each brings into the relationship. That can help couples decide if they are committed to beginning work on the relationship in order to rebuild connection. The reason for this first step of Discernment is because people can often believe that their partner is the sole cause of why the relationship became difficult and disconnected. They sometimes harbor the fantasy that another relationship is going to make life better/ easier / more intimate, etc. Usually, we repeat similar issues in successive relationships so it&rsquo;s ideal to figure out what your contribution is right now in this relationship. In addition, Emotionally-Focused Couples Therapy can help couples to feel more deeply connected through guided vulnerable sharing and bonding. This creates a space where, in essence, partners can re-discover what they fell in love with in the first place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just rekindling that spark by helping partners bond and connect again while stopping the cycle of dis-connection. In couples therapy, we work on the negative pattern that got you feeling alone in the first place and help set it right so that you can learn to communicate effectively again together.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse1" aria-labelledby="heading1" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Absolutely. Infidelity, though hugely painful and upsetting, is something that about 80% of couples who experience it recover from and repair. Couples need four ingredients to do that: 1. End the affair completely. 2. Be willing to talk and admit your mistake. 3. Listen to and express real and repeated empathy for your partner&rsquo;s feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger. 4. Be willing to look at what the larger issue is in the relationship that led to the affair. We have seen many couples recover from infidelity and have helped them to navigate what the larger issues and patterns are in the relationship (often building years before the affair) in order to find a new and more fulfilling connection. Ideally, an affair is an opportunity for the relationship to be re-born on different terms and with new self-awareness for each partner.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse2" aria-labelledby="heading2" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Couples tend to get disconnected through various life events that can throw them into a tailspin usually instigated by a life change or extra stress. All couples have some issues at one time or another. We bring parts of our childhood and old relationships into our current ones in order to heal. We get into negative, repetitive patterns filled with triggers that can resemble some feelings and stories from our family of origin.&nbsp;Those negative cycles can be triggered by minor events like unloading the dishwasher to harder events like disagreements about parenting, finances, or lack of intimacy. Most couples go through hard times and it&rsquo;s normal to struggle to get out of a stuck place without outside help. As therapists, we are there to help restructure present interactions in real-time, guide communication, and discover where deep-rooted patterns originate. This is not a theorizing, wishful thinking kind of therapy. Instead it&rsquo;s highly active, happening experientially and in the moment. That way, the changes we aim to make in our work together are really happening in the moment, not just something we talk about for another day.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse3" aria-labelledby="heading3" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>This is a very common issue. It&rsquo;s really helpful to unpack what has lead to conflict in the parenting realm and how you handle differences with each-other. You don&rsquo;t have to have the exact same parenting values at all times (this would be impossible anyway!) in order to find connection and common ground in parenting. Ultimately, if you are able to slow down and listen to one-another repeatedly around parenting differences, you can learn from your partner&rsquo;s style and influence each-other in positive ways. In EFCT, we work to uncover the negative emotional patterns and old triggers that can hijack you around parenting differences. That way, we can begin to clear the way towards real listening and learning rather than the tendency to try and control or change one-another&rsquo;s parenting.</p>

</div>
<div class="collapse" id="collapse4" aria-labelledby="heading4" data-parent="#faqAccordion">
<div class="card-body"><p>Likely, if you had a bad experience, it&rsquo;s because the therapist was not trained specifically in couples therapy or was not a good fit for you personally. You may not have felt emotionally safe or had personality differences with that clinician. Often, therapists have knowledge in many areas gained through their masters or doctorate degrees and can put on several different hats. But in order to be a fantastic couples therapist, a clinician must be highly trained as a post-graduate in the modality they are offering. All of our therapists have advanced training and / or certification in Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy as well as some other modalities that you can see in their bios. When shopping for a couples therapist, make sure that in addition to a great fit (you feel safe and have the same goals as your therapist), that the clinician you have chosen is highly trained specifically as a couples therapist by a reputable certification body.</p>
