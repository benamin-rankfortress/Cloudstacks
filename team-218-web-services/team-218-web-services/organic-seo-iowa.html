"Keywords": ["undefined"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;We need some basic information such as your NAP (Name, Address, Phone). Then we need to know a little bit about your organization, what you do &ndash; how you do it &ndash; what makes you stand out from your competitors? We have a simple form to fill out that allows you to let us know all about you. After we get that information we follow up with a Zoom call or phone call to answer any questions. That&rsquo;s the simplified version but those are the general steps.&quot;"

"@type": "Question","headline": "undefined","name": "Do You Only Work With WordPress?",

"@type": "Answer",

We&rsquo;ve been developing websites in WordPress since it first came on the scene in the early 2000s. The days of hand coded HTML websites are pretty much over.&Acirc;&quot;"

<p>So in a nutshell, that’s the magic process bringing AI to life! We feed data to algorithms which train learning models to mimic specialized human intelligence skills like seeing, listening, reading, deciding. Then AI feels ready to flex its skills in the real world. Of course, it takes a whole lot of complex math and computing power too! But no need to sweat the technical details – I wanted you to just get an inside look at how AI systems “learn” and “think” in a human-like fashion. The rest is abstract computational wizardry!</p></div>

<div> <p>So in a nutshell, that’s what happens under the AI brain’s hood! We give machines large volumes of data, set algorithms loose on that data to uncover hidden structures, obtain learnings through model building, and enable those learned models to handle new real world data and situations based on their programmed intelligence. The crucial process of machine learning gives AI systems this magical ability to learn, reason and make decisions independently based on their data driven experiences – bringing theory into practical tangible capabilities through code! Keep in mind that AI doesn’t actually create anything – it just rewords, reformats, repurposes existing information and regurgitates it.</p><br><br><h2>Organic SEO Iowa - Circulation problems: Allergies can cause pale skin, dizziness, fainting, and a general feeling of discomfort.

In fact, AI has quietly become deeply woven into the fabric of our everyday lives.</p><p>Let’s start with our handy smartphones. Popular virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant use speech recognition AI to understand our voice commands and natural language processing to respond back smartly.

But we can be sure the pace is only accelerating from here. In many ways the 2020s will be the decisive decade that sets the trajectory for AI advancements for decades to come.

<div class="card-body"><p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;</p>
