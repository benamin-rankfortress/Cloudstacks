"Keywords": ["undefined"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;"

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;We need some basic information such as your NAP (Name, Address, Phone). Then we need to know a little bit about your organization, what you do &ndash; how you do it &ndash; what makes you stand out from your competitors? We have a simple form to fill out that allows you to let us know all about you. After we get that information we follow up with a Zoom call or phone call to answer any questions. That&rsquo;s the simplified version but those are the general steps.&quot;"

"@type": "Question","headline": "undefined","name": "Do You Only Work With WordPress?",

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;Yes, and here&rsquo;s why. WordPress powers over 40% of all websites on the internet. It&rsquo;s an Open Source platform and is extremely adaptable. We&rsquo;ve been developing websites in WordPress since it first came on the scene in the early 2000s. The days of hand coded HTML websites are pretty much over.&Acirc;&quot;"

<div><p>Optimizing for Featured Snippets: Key Strategies - Here’s some tips if you’re hoping to get your stuff into those highlighted featured snippet boxes at the top of Google:</p><p>Format your content like Google wants. Those snippets look nice and scannable ’cause Google cherrypicks content that already uses headings, lists, and clear bitesize facts. So organize your material accordingly! Break it down into meaty sections with headers. Use bullet points and numbered lists for key takeaways. And keep your sentences focused – imagine your reader shouting “get to the point!” as they skim.</p></div>

<div><p>Aim for popular search questions. Check out what terms trigger those featured boxes and specifically target those queries. Write content that directly and fully answers whatever questions pop up when you start typing stuff into Google. Essentially, look at it from the searcher’s perspective – what would someone want summarized at the top?</p></div>

<div class="card-body"><p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;</p>
