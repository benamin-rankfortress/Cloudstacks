"text": "&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;"

Essentially, it’s about machines mimicking human intelligence – things like learning, understanding language, recognizing images, making decisions.

<div> <p>Let’s trace the journey of an AI system and see how it mimics human-level intelligence. First, we need to feed data into these AI machines. AI systems scrape the web for data – lots of data, from images to text documents to numbers. Think of this as the food that fuels AI. Once fed, AI systems preprocess and organize this data so they can analyze it.</p> </div>
