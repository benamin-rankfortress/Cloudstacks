"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;"

"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;We need some basic information such as your NAP (Name, Address, Phone). Then we need to know a little bit about your organization, what you do &ndash; how you do it &ndash; what makes you stand out from your competitors? We have a simple form to fill out that allows you to let us know all about you. After we get that information we follow up with a Zoom call or phone call to answer any questions. That&rsquo;s the simplified version but those are the general steps.&quot;"

"@type": "Question","headline": "undefined","name": "Do You Only Work With WordPress?",

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "&quot;Yes, and here&rsquo;s why. WordPress powers over 40% of all websites on the internet. It&rsquo;s an Open Source platform and is extremely adaptable. We&rsquo;ve been developing websites in WordPress since it first came on the scene in the early 2000s. The days of hand coded HTML websites are pretty much over.&Acirc;&quot;"

<p>On top of making tasks more efficient behind the scenes, AI also makes products and services way smarter and personalized. Think recommendation engines that actually get you, or self-driving cars that could reinvent transportation. The possibilities AI unlocks feels endless.</p><p>But with great power comes some real risks if we aren’t careful. Bias can sneak into these systems in nasty ways if they’re trained on problematic data. That can amplify unfairness and cause all kinds of ethical troubles. And some jobs could be displaced as AI handles more tasks – so retraining and support will be crucial. There are also legit privacy issues to wrestle with thanks to all that data collection and processing.</p></div>

But by planning ahead realistically, having open conversations about ethics and governance now, and demystifying misconceptions – we can steer progress responsibly.

<div class="card-body"><p>&quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, lots of people feel a little overwhelmed and confused and aren&rsquo;t sure how to get started. We recommend that you take some time to browse the internet to look at some websites in your business niche. While you&rsquo;re doing this, make notes of the URL (web address) for sites you like and then include any specifics about what you like. Make note of colors, layout, features and other specifics things you like. Next, think about what you want from your website. I often tell people to imagine the utopia website where you could have anything you want. Make notes of any bells and whistles you want. Then you can work backwards from there if needed, eliminating things that might be too expensive or realistically don&rsquo;t make sense. Always start with anything you can think of and go back from there. It&rsquo;s easier than starting with a minimum and adding to it. Once you have your notes put together you should have a pretty good idea of how to describe what you&rsquo;re looking for when you talk to a web designer.&quot;</p>
