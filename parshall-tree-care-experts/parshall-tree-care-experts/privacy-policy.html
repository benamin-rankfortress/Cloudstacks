<meta name="description" content=""Our mission is to build and inspire a team of tree experts who are revolutionizing urban forest management. Our vision is to be the trusted leader of every community's urban forest. Doug and Corey Parshall had the vision to revolutionize urban forest management for communities in Michigan. They saw that the tree service industry was old and outdated. After 2008, the two of them never looked back. Since 2008, PTCE has been delivering unparalleled tree services that have transformed properties into healthy, beautiful and safe urban forests. ALL of PTCE's practices have questioned the normal or old school way of thinking and have looked for ways to leverage advances in new science, education, technology, and equipment. #trustparshall"">
