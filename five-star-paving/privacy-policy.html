<meta name="description" content=""Five star paving is a full service driveway and parking lot company in indianapolis , the owner Frank is on all job sites from start to finish .. we dont just send a sales man out and a crew . Frank or a family member gives the estimate , then frank is there the whole time , would you rather have a sales man sign you up and while your project is getting done he is out trying to sell more work , he just briefed the Forman todo your project? I would much rather deal with 1 person from start to finish. We have been paving in indy for over 40 yrs . Always think about , sometimes the big contractor with 15 guys isnt the best for you .. maybe that familey owned business is what you want because there going todo your job like there own ."">
